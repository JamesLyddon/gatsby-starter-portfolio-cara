## About

> For the past few years I've been juggling being a stay at home dad with learning front-end development, going from `hello world!` to a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, & React.

Initially I was self-taught, following programs such as
<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50</a>, <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend" target="_blank">Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path</a>, and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript Mastery</a>. More recently I've been studing MSc Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of York.

I'm currently looking for a junior position at a company where I can put my skills to work while continuing to improve and expand my skillset. I'm particularly interested in developing 3D experiences with React Three Fiber with an eye to developing AR and VR experiences.
